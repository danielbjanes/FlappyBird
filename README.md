# Flappy Bird NEAT Machine Learning

The goal of the project is to solve Flappy Bird using the Neura-evolution of augmenting topolgies algorithm. I modified a pre-existing neural network JS library and created a genetic algorithm to pregressivly train an AI to play Flappy Bird.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) - Dependancy
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Language 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Webserver
### Installing

1. Install/update Javascript
2. Install/update Python
3. Installing P5.js is not required as the default library comes with the project yet is recommended
4. Clone or download the git repository
5. Open the file in terminal and open a simple python web server
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer PORTNUMBER
6. Connect to localhost:PORTNUMBER
7. Enjoy :)
